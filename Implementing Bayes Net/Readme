In this project, you will implement inference algorithms for Bayes Nets, specifically variable elimination
and value-of-perfect-information computations. These inference algorithms will allow you to reason
about the existence of invisible pellets and ghosts.The code for this homework contains the following
files, available as a zip archive attached to the same post on piazza as this document.
